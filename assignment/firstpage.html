            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira,
                Portugal), Portuguese football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players of his generation.

                Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name
                Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan,
                who
                was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart
                condition
                that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played
                for
                Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as
                Sporting
                Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first
                team in 2002.</p>

                At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was
                impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's
                under-16

               <li><b>Manchester United</b></li>

                Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community
                Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season and

                Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of
                £80 million (€94 million).[106] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and
                contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[107] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the
                Santiago
